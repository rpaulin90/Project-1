# English Premier League Predictions Game
This app will let you show your knowledge of the English Premier League week by week. Users compete throughout the whole season (or can join at any point) trying to guess the correct result for each game. They can follow the total rankings and their own personal performance by logging into their profile, where they will also find a news and an information tool that will let them educate themselves about any team before making a final decision.

# How it's been done for years
The way this game is played today is by having a "league manager" send a weekly email with an excel file attachment containing the games for that week. Players then edit that excel file and send it back to the league manager. The league manager populates another excel file with all the users' picks. After the games are done, the manager has to input the results in his excel file and generate a table with the latest rankings.

# It does not have to be this way!
Our app generates a list of games to be played each week and lets the users make their predictions in their own personal profiles. Their performance is tracked by the app and updates the rankings table even when games are being played. Other features include a chart with weekly performance throughout the season, the ability to change their picks at any mooment before the deadline and a newsfeed tool included in the same page. This feature enables users to do some ground research on specific teams before making their picks and it's more convenient that having to open new tabs to get the information from other websites.
